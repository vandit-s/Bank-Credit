Performed Exploratory Data Analysis to identify patterns that indicate if a client has difficulty paying their installments which may be used for taking necessary actions

The loan providing companies find it hard to give loans to the people due to their insufficient or non-existent credit history. Because of that, some consumers use it to their advantage by becoming a defaulter.

The analysis aims to:

• Identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their instalments which may be used for taking actions such as:

 Denying the loan,

 Reducing the amount of loan,

 Lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

• This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.

• The company can utilize this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.
